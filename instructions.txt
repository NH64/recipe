Ingredients
5 pounds beef short ribs
1 Asian pear, cored and cubed
1 onion, coarsely chopped
5 cloves garlic
1 cup soy sauce 
1 cup brown sugar
¼ cup honey
¼ cup sesame oil
black pepper to taste

Directions

Step 1
Place ribs in a large pot and cover with cold water. Soak ribs in the refrigerator for 1 hour to pull out any blood. Drain.

Step 2
Combine Asian pear, onion, and garlic in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour into a large bowl and stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil, and black pepper. Add ribs to soy mixture; turn to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.

Step 3
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.

Step 4
Remove ribs from marinade and cook on the preheated grill until meat is tender and the outside is crusty, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Discard marinade.
